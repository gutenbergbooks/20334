 <h1>PUNCH,<br />
  OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.</h1>

  <h2>Vol. 159.</h2>
  <hr class="full" />

  <h2>29th December, 1920.</h2>
  <hr class="full" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>[pg 501]</span>


<h4>CHARIVARIA.</h4>

<p>No newspapers were published on
Saturday, Sunday or Monday. We did
not begrudge them their holiday, but
we do think <i>The Daily Mail</i> might have
issued occasional bulletins respecting
the weather at Thanet, as we consider
three days is too long to keep their
readers in suspense.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The most popular indoor game this
winter seems to be Battledore-and-Juttlecock.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A woman informed a London magistrate
last Tuesday that her husband
thrashed her at Easter, Whitsuntide
and on August Bank
Holiday. Our thoughts
were constantly with
her during the recent
Yuletide festivities.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Readers should not
be alarmed if a curious
rustling noise is heard
next Saturday morning.
It will be simply the
sound of new leaves being
turned over.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In view of the possible
increase of their
salaries it is not the
intention of Members
of Parliament to solicit
Christmas-boxes.
Householders, therefore,
should be on their
guard against men passing
themselves off as
M.P.s.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Our attention is drawn
to the fact that the latest
photograph of Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>
shows him to be smoking a cigar with
the band on. We can only say that
<span class="sc">Cromwell</span> wouldn't have done it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Our magistrates appear to be made
of poor stuff these days. A man named
<span class="sc">Snail</span> was last week summoned before
the Feltham magistrates for exceeding
the speed limit, yet no official joke was
made. Incidentally, why is it that
Mr. Justice <span class="sc">Darling</span> never gets a real
chance like this?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A New York policeman has been
arrested in the act of removing a safe
from a large drapery store. It is said
that upon being seen by another policeman
he offered to run and fetch a burglar.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mme. <span class="sc">Delysia</span> has been bitten by a
dog in New York. The owner's defence,
that the animal had never tasted
famous dancer before, is not likely to be
accepted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Like a soothing balm just before the
old year dies comes the intimation from
Mr. <span class="sc">Lovat Fraser</span> that there is a bright
side to things.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>With reference to the opening of the
pantomime season it is reported that
a couple of new jokes have been found
nesting in a Glasgow theatre.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Psychologists are inclined to attribute
the recent night stampede of sheep in
the Midlands, when thousands of them
jumped their hurdles, to the influence
of a large number of people concentrating
on a well-known remedy for sleeplessness.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is stated that rabies does not
exist in Ireland. Our opinion is that
it wouldn't be noticed if it did.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Very few English Christmas customs,
we hear, are prevalent out in Russia.
We have always felt that the custom of
clients giving Christmas-boxes to their
executioners will never become very
popular.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is rumoured that the repeated
assassinations of General <span class="sc">Villa</span> have
made it necessary for him to resign his
position as Permanent Chief Insurgent
to the State of Mexico.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Morning Post</i> has remarked that
nowadays the Eton boy is often reduced
to travelling third-class. It is hoped to
persuade Sir <span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span> to disguise
himself as an Eton boy during the holidays
to see how it feels.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is now admitted that the plum-pudding
which was badly mauled by a
small boy in the Hoxton district on
Christmas Day began it by inviting his
assailant to "come on."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">D'Annunzio</span> is reported to be coming
to a more reasonable frame of mind.
Apparently he is disposed to allow Italy
a certain measure of independence.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>People step out into the road and
never look to right or left, says a London
coroner. This makes things far too
easy for motorists.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Dr. <span class="sc">A. Graham Bell</span>
recently told a Derby
audience how he invented
the telephone.
We note that he still
refuses to say why.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We are informed that,
on and after the 1st of
January, Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>
cannot undertake
to refute the opinions
of any writer who has
not been officially recognised
as a best seller.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A scientist has succeeded
in putting a pea
to sleep with electro-magnetism.
The clumsy
old method of drowning
it in a plate of soup
should now be a thing
of the past.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>General <span class="sc">Townshend</span>
says that with seventy thousand men
he could have conquered half Asia.
But then he might have lost Mr.
<span class="sc">Horatio Bottomley</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>What we want now is something to
make the world safe for those who made
the world safe for democracy.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>There is now on the market a new
patent contrivance which gives warning
when the contents of an oven are on
the point of burning. We have secured
a sample, but unfortunately our cook
still relies on her sense of smell.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Leather is now much cheaper," we
read. Yet we have noticed no drop in
the price of restaurant steak.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On January 1st the Ministry of Munitions
will enter upon its second year
of winding up.</p>

<h4>OUR GOGGLERS.</h4>
<p class="center"><i>First Girl in grandmotherly spectacles (to second ditto).</i> "<span class="sc">How

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>[pg 502]</span>

<h3>THE HAPPY HOOTS.</h3>

<p>Yes, it is nearly twelve now. In
ten minutes we shall hear the bells&mdash;I
mean the hooters. I wonder if there
were hooters when <span class="sc">Tennyson</span> wrote
those popular lines about ringing in the
New Year. Very likely he didn't hear
them if there were, as there's nothing
to show that he ever really stayed up
late enough to see the New Year in.
It's a pity, because the hooters would
have fitted in to that poem most beautifully.
The hooting idea is just what is
wanted to give a dramatic contrast to
the sugary ringing business.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Ring out the false, ring in the true"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>doesn't <i>convince</i> somehow; it's too
impartial. One doesn't say to the footman,
"Show the Rector up, please, and
show this blackmailer out," even at the
Lyceum. One says, "<i>Kick</i> this black-hearted
hound out," and the footman
realises then that you have something
against the fellow. Just so one doesn't
gather from the above line that the
poet has any strong preference as between
the false and the true, except
that there is no good rhyme to "the
false," unless you can count "waltz";
but what about&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hoot</i> out the old, ring in the new;</p>
<p><i>Hoot</i> out the false, ring in the true?</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Magnificent! There's some sting in
that; it "gets over," and it brings the
whole poem into harmony with modern
practice.</p>

<p>Come on, we'd better have another
dance before the great moment. I
wonder if <span class="sc">Tennyson</span> ever saw the New
Year in at two guineas a head. I don't
expect so. For that matter it's the
first time we've done it at an expensive
public "Revel" ourselves; but then
this is the first year we've been absolutely
bankrupt. Up till now we've
been rather well off, and have celebrated
cheaply at home. Do you realise
that this is our wedding-day? I believe
you'd forgotten; women never
remember these things. Yes, it's six
years ... Six years. And this is the
first year we've been bankrupt. All
the same, as I say, it's the first year
we've come out and had a jolly good
supper. Reckless? Yes, I'm afraid
we are. But we've caught it from the
Government ... However, to-morrow
we'll start a new cheque-book.</p>

<p>Have you made your resolutions yet?
I have. Do you remember this time
last year? You said you'd keep accounts,
and I said I wouldn't smoke so
much. And all the year through our
resolution has never wavered. I've got
evidence of that. Look at my diary.
Here we are:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>January 1st.</i>&mdash;G. started keeping accounts.
Gave up smoking.</p>

<p>And here we are again:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>March 20th.</i>&mdash;G. started accounts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -1em;"><i>March 29th.</i>&mdash;Knocked off smoking.</p>

<p>That shows it was no mere flash-in-the-pan,
doesn't it?</p>

<p>And we <i>went on</i> like that. Look at
this:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>June 6th.</i>&mdash;Gave up smoking.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -1em;"><i>June 7th.</i>&mdash;Only one pipe since yesterday.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -1em;"><i>June 30th.</i>&mdash;Cut myself down to four
pipes a day.</p>

<p style="margin-top: -1em;"><i>July 1st-9th.</i>&mdash;G. keeping accounts;
knocked off smoking.</p>

<p>But I wonder why I kept writing it
down. Even in September, you see, I
wasn't taking it for granted:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>September 29th.</i>&mdash;Quarter-Day. Not
smoking this quarter. G. began new
system of accounts.</p>

<p>It looks like bragging, doesn't it?
But I don't think I can have meant it
that way. Still, it is rather marvellous,
when you come to think of it&mdash;here we
are, after all these months, twelve of
them, and we still stick doggedly to
the same unswerving resolution. Nothing
can alter it. That's what I call
tenacity of purpose.</p>

<p>You don't think I'm serious? But
I am. I'm just as serious as I was
last year. This year I <i>shall</i> give up
smoking. Only I think you ought to
give up your hot-water bottle in sympathy.
You won't? No, I know you
won't. You're a slave of the bottle,
you see. It doesn't do you any harm?
Oh, yes it does. It makes your backbone
flabby, and it makes you susceptible
to colds, and it gives you chilblains,
and, anyhow, it's morally pernicious,
because it's an <i>indulgence</i> ... If I'd
known you were a hot-water-bottle
woman before we were married ...
However, we needn't go into that. But
if you won't give up your bottle I
shan't give up smoking after all.</p>

<p>Look, they're opening the windows.
We shall all catch cold. Can you hear
anything? I can hear those people
eating. What a draught! Can you
hear anything? I can hear the eaters
quite plainly now. Here comes Father
Christmas. I believe he is going to
give us all gifts.</p>

<p>Can you hear anything yet? I have
been given a diary. What have you
got? Another diary? Is yours for
1921? So is mine. How dull! Christmas
will be on a Sunday next year, I
see. So will our wedding-day. I hope
you'll remember it this time. And
they have arranged for the Spring to
begin on March 21st. Think of it!
Spring&mdash;in less than three months!</p>

<p>There they go.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Hoot out, wild hooters, to the wild sky!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>What a jolly noise! Much better than
bells, really much more accurate as an expression
of one's feelings. There's a sort
of "faint but pursuing" note about it.
And that's how I feel, rather. It was
a dreadful year, really, wasn't it?&mdash;that
last one, I mean. No money, no
clothes&mdash;nothing but rates and dentists
and small accounts respectfully submitted
for our esteemed favour. One
long crisis.... But we kept the flag
flying. This year&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Hallo! somebody 's going to recite.
What do you think it will be? You'll
never guess. Yes, you're quite right.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Ring out a slowly-dying cause</p>
<p>And ancient forms of party strife.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>That sounds like a bit of Government
propaganda. Disgraceful, I call it. If
I was a Wee Free&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Ring in the nobler modes of life,</p>
<p>With sweeter manners&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>That's a hit at somebody, too, I
shouldn't wonder. Somebody must have
written a topical verse for the occasion.
Those people are still eating. I expect
they are doing Hog-money, or whatever
it is....</p>

<p>Are you still as obstinate as ever
about that hot-water bottle? Very well,
then, I shall now have the first smoke
of the New Year. Oh, no; we 've got
to do <i>Auld Lang Syne</i> first. I never
<i>can</i> smoke while I'm singing.</p>

<p>"Should auld acquaintance ..."
Do you know any of the people here?
No? Do you ever want to see any of
them again? No? Never mind, they've
all paid a lot of money to hold our
hands; let them have their money's
worth ... "A right gude willie-waucht
..." Waiter! One large willie-waucht,
please, and a small pint stoup ... Do
you realise that this is the only night
in the year when you can get a willie-waucht
at this hour? What a world!</p>

<p>Six years. Do you see that nice
couple over there? I bet they haven't
been married as long as we have. And
I bet they're not so bankrupt. This is
going to be a dreadful year. I can see
that at once. But we'll keep the flag
flying.</p>

<p>Ah, here come the willie-wauchts.
Thank you, waiter.</p>

<p>Well, my dear&mdash;a cup of kindness
with you. Here's luck!</p>

<h3>ELIZABETH'S CHRISTMAS.</h3>

<p>"I've always thort 'ow I'd love to
'ave a reel nice Christmas," remarked
Elizabeth&mdash;"a jolly proper kind o' one,
you know, 'm."</p>

<p>"Don't you find Christmas a pleasant
time, then?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, 'm, I bin in service
ever since I was turned fifteen, an' you
know wot Christmas in service is. An
extry tip, I will say, but a lot of extry
work to go along with it&mdash;and wot
washin' up! Some'ow it orl seems so
different in books an' on the pictures."</p>

<p>She sighed as she spoke and a look
that was almost human crept into the
arid region of her countenance. A
feeling of compunction swept over me.
Was it possible that this poor simple
girl concealed depths of conviviality in
her nature and a genial disposition
which I, in common with all her former
employers, had carelessly overlooked?
I will admit that this unexpected phase
in Elizabeth's character touched and
interested me.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," I cried in a sudden glow
of enthusiasm, "you shall have your
jolly Christmas&mdash;I will provide it. You
shall have your turkey, plum-pudding,
mince-pies, crackers, mistletoe and all
the rest of it." <i>Cheeryble</i> in his most
beneficent mood could not have felt
more expansive than I did just then.
"You can invite your friends; we shall
not be at home, so you will have the
place to yourself."</p>

<p>"Lor!" she ejaculated. "D'ye reerly
mean it, 'm?"</p>

<p>"I do, Elizabeth. Let me know the
sort of Christmas you've always longed
for and I'll see that you get it."</p>

<p>She drew up her lank form and her
face shone. "Well, 'm, I don't know
where you get 'em, but for one thing
I've often thort as 'ow I'd like to 'ave
a festlebord."</p>

<p>"What's that?" I asked, puzzled.
"Is it in the Stores' list?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, 'm, but there's always
a lot about it in the books. When
the Squire's son comes 'ome repentant
at Christmas-tide they always gathers
round a festlebord and rejoices."</p>

<p>I began to see light. "You mean a
'festal board'?"</p>

<p>"That's wot I sed, 'm."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall have one, Elizabeth,
I'll see to that. I'd let you have a
Squire's son as well, but unfortunately
the only ones I know are not repentant&mdash;as
yet. And now tell me which of
your friends you would like to invite."</p>

<p>"There's my sister-in-lor 'ud like to
come&mdash;'er that I 'aven't been on speakin'
terms with for five years&mdash;but she
shan't. An' my friend isn't comin'; I'll
see to that arter the things she sed
about me to my young man's cousin&mdash;sorcy
baggage! As for my two aunts
they don't set foot under the same roof
as me arter the way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind about the people you're
not inviting," I broke in; "we don't
need a list of them. Who do you want
to come?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's Mrs. Spurge, the
char&mdash;a real nice lady, as you know,
'm. Then I'd like to arsk Polly, the
sister of the cook wot lives in the 'ouse
at the corner with red 'air; an' there's
Mary Baxter. An' isn't it lucky my
sailor-brother will be 'ome for the first
time in ten years? Can 'e come too,
'm? 'E's been round the world twice."</p>

<p>"In that case, Elizabeth, he certainly
ought to be invited. He may even have
returned home repentant, so you will
be able to rejoice at the festal board in
proper style."</p>

<p>"Oh, 'm, isn't it luverly? I won't
'arf have a beano this Christmas. Wot
a time we'll 'ave, <i>wot</i> a time!"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>For my part I did not pass a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>[pg 505]</span>
blithesome Christmas. Henry's aunt,
who invited us, is rich, but she is also
dull, and several times I found myself
rather envying Elizabeth. While Aunt
Jane nodded in her chair, Henry and
I pictured those boisterous revels of
Elizabeth and her friends, their boundless
mirth, their unrestrained gaiety.
We imagined them too gathered round
the sailor-brother, listening with rapt
delight as he told them stories of the
far-off wonder-lands he had known.
Henry sighed then and said there were
times when he envied the so-called
lower classes their capacity for enjoyment.</p>

<p>When we returned home Elizabeth
greeted us with beaming countenance.
"I 'ope you 'ad a good time," she said;
"I know <i>I</i> 'ad."</p>

<p>"Then it really was as nice as you
thought it would be, Elizabeth?"</p>

<p>"It was first-rate, 'm. Leastways
orl went well until arter dinner, when
we begins chippin' each other and ends
in 'avin' a few words. My sailor-brother
started it by chaffin' Polly
about 'er red 'air an' arskin' why she
didn't cut it orf, an' she told 'im then
that if 'e'd such an objection to red she
wondered 'e didn't cut 'is own nose orf.
Arter that one thing led to another; we
took sides an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Elizabeth, you don't mean to
say you quarrelled?" I interrupted sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it wasn't quarrellin', 'm&mdash;just
bargin', you know. Any'ow it
ended in Polly an' Mary an' my brother
goin' off early. I was chilly to Mrs.
Spurge owin' to 'er 'avin' said that she
didn't believe my sailor-brother 'd ever
been further than Wapping in a coal-barge.
I shouldn't 'ave spoke to 'er
again that evenin' if the book 'adn't
brought us together again friendly,
like."</p>

<p>"What book?" I asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"One of yours that I got out of the
study, 'm. Oh, <i>wot</i> a book! Sorter
ghost story in a manner o' speakin'. I
laughed an' I cried over it, turn about.
So did Mrs. Spurge. You see we read
bits out to each other&mdash;kep it up till
three o'clock in the mornin', we did.
It was luverly!"</p>

<p>"And what was the book called?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"It's called <i>A Christmas Car'l</i>, 'm,
by Mr. <span class="sc">Dickings</span>. Why didn't nobody
tell me about it afore? It's far
better 'n the pictures. 'Just like
'eaven,' Mrs. Spurge said."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you enjoyed yourself,
Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"It's the 'appiest Christmas I ever
'ad, 'm. That there Mr. Dickings is
a one! 'E do know wot's wot in festlebords."</p>

<h3>MAYBIRDS.</h3>

<p>I can see some justification for keeping
peacocks, especially if you have
shaven lawns and terraces and sundials,
though sundials, I imagine, are
rather a nuisance now-a-days, because
of the trouble of having them reset for
summer and winter time. Peacocks at
any rate are beautiful, and, if their voices
are apt in England to become a little
hoarse, that is only because they screech
when the weather is going to be bad.</p>

<p>The pheasant is also a useful and
beautiful fowl. One may put down
bread-crumbs to attract the pheasant
to one's garden when he is alive, or to
one's plate when he is dead.</p>

<p>But I can see no justification whatever
for keeping maybirds, for they
are neither useful nor beautiful. Perhaps
you do not know what a maybird
is. I have five maybirds. I have them
because people here would keep saying
to me, "Look at the price of fresh eggs,
and how much nicer it is to have your
own." It is a curious thing about the
country that people are always giving
one disinterested advice in the matter
of domestic economy. In London it is
different. In London people let you
take a twopenny bus ticket to Westminster
instead of walking across the
Park, and go to ruin in your own sweet
way. They rather admire your dash.
But in the country they tell you about
these things.</p>

<p>So I went to a man and confessed to
him my trouble about fresh eggs.</p>

<p>"I see," he said; "you want maybirds."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," I said; "I want hens."</p>

<p>"It's the same thing," he told me.
"How many would you like?"</p>

<p>"Five," I said. I thought five would
be an unostentatious number and make
it clear that I was not trying to compete
with the wholesale egg-dealers.</p>

<p>He segregated five maybirds and explained
their points to me.</p>

<p>It appeared that one of them was a
Buff Orpington and three were white
Wyandottes and one had no particular
politics. I should say now that it was
an Independent. It has speckles and is
the one that keeps getting into the
garden.</p>

<p>I asked him when the creatures
would begin to enter upon their new
duties, and he said they would do so at
once.</p>

<p>"What is their maximum egg-laying
velocity?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"They'll lay about three eggs a day
between them," he said, "these five
birds."</p>

<p>"Why between them?" I enquired.
But I consented to buy his birds, and
he said if I liked he would run round
to my garden at once and run up a hen-house
and a hen-run for me. "Run"
seemed rather a word with him.</p>

<p>I said, "Yes, by all means."</p>

<p>He came round that evening and
hewed down an apple-tree under the
light of the moon to make room for
the maybird-run, and in the morning
he brought a large roll of wire-netting,
and the next day he built a wooden
house, and the day after that he brought
his five maybirds, and the day after
that he came round and asked for some
cinders. He sprinkled these all over
the enclosure, and I watched him while
he worked.</p>

<p>"What is that for?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They want something to scratch in
when they run about," he explained.
"Exercise is what they need."</p>

<p>"They seem to be scratching already,
but they don't seem to be running," I
said. "Wouldn't it have been better
to put a cinder-track all round the
edge and train them to run races round
it?"</p>

<p>He said that he hadn't thought of
that, but I could try it if I liked. Then
he gave me a bag of food, which he
said was particularly efficacious for
maybirds, and produced his bill.</p>

<p>All this happened about a month ago,
and for the last four weeks the principal
preoccupation of my household
has been the feeding of these five birds.
I have had to lay a gravel-path from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>[pg 507]</span>
the aviary to the back premises in order
to sustain the weight of the traffic.
Huge bowls of hot food are constantly
being mixed and carried to them, without
any apparent consciousness on their
part of their reciprocal responsibilities.
What I mean to say is that there are
no eggs. The food which they eat resembles
Christmas-pudding at the time
when it is stirred, and I have suggested
that a sixpence should be concealed in
it every now and then&mdash;sixpence being
apparently the current price of an egg&mdash;in
order to indicate the nature of
our hopes.</p>

<p>I have made other valuable suggestions.
I have suggested putting an
anthracite stove in their sitting-room,
and papering the walls with illustrations
representing various methods of mass
production, ordinary methods having
failed. I notice that cabbages are suspended
by a string across the top of the
parade-ground in order that the birds
may obtain exercise by springing at
them. The cabbages are eaten, but I
do not believe that the birds jump. I
believe that they clamber up the wire
with their claws, walk along the tight-rope
and bite the cabbage off with their
teeth.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as I think I have mentioned,
the one with speckles escapes
into the garden, and I have several
times been asked to chase it home.
Nothing makes one look more ridiculous
than chasing an independent maybird of
no particular views across an onion bed.
The rest of the animals appear to spend
most of their time in walking about the
run with their hands in their pockets
looking for things on the ground.</p>

<p>But every now and then one or other
of them makes the loud cry which is
usually associated with successful egg-production;
the whole household troops
beaming with anticipation along the
gravel-path; and it is then discovered
that the Buff has knocked one of the
Whites off her perch, or that one of
the Whites has scratched a cinder on
which the Buff had set her eye, or that
the Independent member has made a
bitter speech which is deeply resented
by the Coalition. But there are no
eggs.</p>

<p>About a week ago the corn which
apparently forms a part of the necessary
nourishment of maybirds, and is
kept in an outhouse, was attacked by
rats. I was told that I must do something
about this. I buttered some
slices of bread with arsenic and laid
them down on the outhouse floor. The
rats ate the bread and arsenic and went
on with the corn. Unless a great improvement
is manifested in the New
Year I have decided to butter the maybirds
with arsenic and place them in
the outhouse too.</p>

<h3>LETTERS I NEVER POSTED.</h3>

<h3>CONCERNING GOOD RESOLUTIONS.</h3>

<h4><span class="sc1">To the girl at the Exchange</span>.</h4>

<p>The New Year is upon us and with
it comes the determination to mend
our bad habits and make serious efforts
to turn over a new leaf. Perhaps you
have already thought of this and have
made some good resolutions; perhaps,
on the other hand, you cannot think of
anything amiss that needs correcting.
In this case will you let me help you<i>?</i>
In every other respect you may be perfection,
but as an exchange operator,
which is the only capacity in which
(alas!) I know you, you are often lacking.
I have no doubt that you are
charming in private life and that we
should get on famously if we met at
dinner; but you have an irritating way
of giving me the wrong number, which
I do most cordially hope you will lose
during 1921. When I protest, you
merely say you are sorry, but what I
suggest is that an ounce of careful listening
at first is worth tons of sorrow
later. Kingston doesn't really sound
a bit like Brixton, and yet yesterday,
when I asked for a Kingston number,
you put me at once on to the same
number in the other suburb. Constantly
when I say I want 2365 you
give me 2356. To give you your due
you are always, I will admit, sorry;
but ...</p>

<p>Another thing. Sometimes, when you
ring me up and I answer, all you do is
to ask, "Number, please," as though I
had rung you. (It is then that I feel
most that I should like to wring you.)
When I reply, "But you rang me,"
you revert to your prevailing regretful
melancholy and say, "Sorry you were
troubled," and before I can go deeply
into the question and discover how
these things occur you ring off. Can't
you make an effort during 1921 not to
do this? Let it be a year of gladness.</p>

<p>Sometimes I am perfectly certain you
don't ring up the number I want until
after you have asked me once or twice
if they have answered. Isn't that so?
"I'll ring them again," you say with
a kind of resigned adventurousness; but,
knowing as I do that they have been
waiting for my call, I am not taken in.
But what I want to know is&mdash;what
were you doing instead of ringing up
at first? I suppose that these secrets
will never be penetrated by the ordinary
subscriber outside the sacred precincts;
but I wish you would give me
fewer of such problems to ponder during
the year that is coming.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Have you ever considered, with
proper alarm, what would happen to a
cinema story if a wrong number were
provided by the operator, or if any
delay whatever occurred? This should
make you think.</p>

<h4><span class="sc1">To a Racing Journalist</span>.</h4>

<p>I suggest that you should include
among your good resolutions for the
New Year the decision not to allow
your readers to participate in your
special information as to which horse
will come in first. Tell them all you
like about yesterday's sport, but dangle
no more "security tips" before their
diminishing purses. If they must bet&mdash;which
of course they must, as betting
is now the principal national industry&mdash;let
them at least have the fun of
selecting the "also-ran" themselves.</p>

<h4><span class="sc1">To Many an Editor</span>.</h4>

<p>In contemplating your 1921 programme
of regeneration could you not
make a vow to dispense with all headlines
that ask questions? Probably you
never see the paper yourself and therefore
have no feeling in the matter, but
I can assure you that the habit can become
very wearisome. "Will it freeze
to-day?" "Can Beckett win?" "Will
Hobbs reach his 3,000 runs?" "Are
the Lords going to pass the Bill?"
Won't you make an effort to do without
this formula? It is futile in itself
and has the unfortunate effect of raising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>[pg 509]</span>
what surely are undesirable doubts as
to whether journalists are any more
sensible than their readers.</p>

<h4><span class="sc1">To One Editor in Particular</span>.</h4>

<p>No comic hats in 1921, please.</p>

<h4><span class="sc1">To the P.M.G.</span></h4>

<p>There is, as everyone (except possibly
Mr. <span class="sc">Austen Chamberlain</span> and the cynic
who professes to hate letters so much
that he wishes that they cost a shilling
a-piece to send) will agree, one good
resolution which above all others you
should concentrate upon for 1921, and
that is to get back our penny postage.
With so many comparatively unnecessary
things still untaxed, it never should
have been sacrificed.</p>

<h4><span class="sc1">To A Pork Butcher</span>.</h4>

<p>Among the problems of this latter
day of discontents few are more pressing
than speculating as to why sausages
and pork-pies have so degenerated.
Under the malign influence of Peace,
sausages have become tasteless and
pork-pies nothing but pies with pork
in them; the crust chiefly plaster-of-Paris,
and the meat not an essential
element, soft and seductive and fused
with the pastry, but an alien assortment
of half-cooked cubes. I can understand
that after a great war a certain
deterioration must set in, but I fail to
see why sausages and pork-pies, if made
at all, should not be made as well as
ever, especially as you get such a long
price for them. Couldn't you&mdash;wouldn't
you&mdash;try in 1921 to make them with
some at least of the old care?</p>

<h4><span class="sc1">To a Cabinet Minister</span>.</h4>

<p>Might not a vow against writing for
the papers be rather a nice one to observe
during 1921? It is quite on the
cards that one's duties to the State
(not too inadequately paid for) ought
to be sufficiently exacting to preclude
journalism at all. There's a question
of dignity too, although I hesitate to
drag that in.</p>

<h4><span class="sc1">To the Chief of the Police</span>.</h4>

<p>Couldn't you (I hope I am addressing
the right gentleman) arrange that
before 1921 becomes 1922&mdash;twelve whole
months&mdash;a simple device is made for
taxis by which a square of red glass
can be slipped over one of the lamps at
night to indicate that the cab is free?
I'm sure it wouldn't really be difficult,
and the comfort of London would be
enormously increased.</p>

<h4><span class="sc1">To A Taxi-Driver</span>.</h4>

<p>You will perhaps note what I have
just said to the Chief of the Police. If
you had any interest in your work you
would, of course, long since have fixed
up something of the kind for yourself.
But let that pass. All I am suggesting
to you as a 1921 amendment is that
you should bank in a more accessible
part of your clothing. Waiting for
change in this weather (especially with
the flag still down) can be an exasperating
experience. Won't you make
a resolution during the coming year to
keep your money nearer the surface?</p>

<h3>THE BARKER THAT MISSED FIRE.</h3>

<p>On hearing a shuffle of feet in the
porch and the clearing of little throats,
I exclaimed, "Those carols again!" If
between "those" and "carols" I inserted
another word, I withdraw it.</p>

<p>I went into the hall and barked like
a dog.</p>

<p>I have often said that, if anyone
could earn a hundred pounds a week
on the stage by barking like a dog, I
could. Children like to come to my
house to tea merely for the thrill of
listening to my imitation. I used to
flatter myself that I could bark like a
dog even better than <span class="sc">Nelson Keys</span> can
imitate <span class="sc">Gerald du Maurier</span>.</p>

<p>I hardly gave the carol-singers time
even to mention Royal David's city
before I barked. Instantly one pair of
little feet scuttled away towards the
gate; then a voice called, "Don't be
silly, Alfy; come on back."</p>

<p>Two small girls stood at the front-door
as I opened it. One of them
smiled up at me and said, "He thinks
he's going to be bit." She appeared
to be amused by the idea. Down by
the gate was a small muffled figure
carrying a Chinese lantern. "Come on
back, Alfy," she called again, "and let's
sing to the gentleman. You see," she
explained to me in confidence, "he's
got addleoids and can't sing loud, so we
let him hold the lantern."</p>

<p>I was beginning to feel sorry that I
had played a trick on such inoffensive
children and was about to assure them
that my savage bull-terrier was safely
locked up in the kitchen when the brave
little lass began chattering again.</p>

<p>"My dad keeps dogs&mdash;all sorts," she
told me, "and sells them to gentlemen.
So I'm used to dogs." Then she turned
once more to the lantern-bearer and
commanded, "Now come on and sing,
Alfy. It ain't a dog at all; it's only
the gentleman trying to make a noise
like one."</p>

<p><i>Monday, December 20th</i>.&mdash;As the result
of being tossed backwards and
forwards between the two Houses the
Government of Ireland Bill had already
lost most of its awkward corners. The
last two were rounded off to-day, when
the Government secured that Southern
Ireland should have three years, instead
of two, in which to make up her mind
whether to accept or refuse the proffered
Parliament, and that in the meantime
only a joint resolution of both
Houses should prevent the Act from
coming into operation. Lord <span class="sc">Midleton</span>
pressed hard for a retention of the
Lords' veto, but was thrown overboard
by Lord <span class="sc">Crewe</span>, who was greatly impressed
by the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor's</span>
reminder that within three years there
must be a General Election.</p>

<p>In the Commons Sir <span class="sc">Robert Horne</span>
performed his customary Monday dance
among the fiscal egg-shells. He declined
to give an estimate as to the
number of British workmen unemployed
owing to the importation of
German goods&mdash;"no man who breathes
could do it"&mdash;and judiciously evaded
acceptance of Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Hall's</span>
suggestion that one reason why Teuton
manufacturers were snapping up Dominion
contracts was that their employ&eacute;s
worked eleven hours a day.</p>

<p>The close of one of the longest and
weariest sessions on record finds the
Government in a penitent mood. How
long will it last? The <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>
told one of his supporters that he hoped
next year's programme would be less
exacting, and immediately promised
another measure dealing with dumping
and exchange; and when Sir <span class="sc">F. Banbury</span>
helpfully suggested that the surest
way to avoid an Autumn Session would
be to introduce fewer Bills Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar
Law</span> turned on him with the retort
that "a surer way would be to introduce
none."</p>

<p>An amusing duel between well-matched
opponents took place over
liquor control. Mr. <span class="sc">Macquisten</span>, whose
voice, at once insinuating and penetrative,
has been likened to a corkscrew,
urged that the <i>bon&acirc;-fide</i> frequenters of
public-houses should be consulted in the
settlement of the drink regulations. The
present arrangement, in his view, was
like entrusting the regulation of the
Churches to avowed atheists. Lady
<span class="sc">Astor</span> made full use of her shrill treble
in retorting that it was the "victims"&mdash;by
which apparently she meant the
wives of Mr. <span class="sc">Macquisten's</span> <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>&mdash;who
ought to have the last word. She
herself had it in the series of incredulous
"Oh's!"&mdash;uttered <i>crescendo</i> on a rising
scale and accompanied by appropriate
gesture&mdash;with which she received Mr.
<span class="sc">Macquisten's</span> confident assertion that
the working-men's clubs are the enemies
of "the Trade."</p>

<p>Supplementary Estimates produced
a good deal of miscellaneous information.
On the Vote for Road Transport
Colonel <span class="sc">Mildmay</span> attacked the system
of tar-spraying and told a melancholy
story of a cow that skidded with fatal
results. He was backed up by Sir <span class="sc">F.
Banbury</span>, who said that he had found
the ideal pavement in soft wood and
awakened memories of an ancient jest
by suggesting that something might
be done if he and the <span class="sc">Minister of
Transport</span> were to put their heads
together.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, December 21st.</i>&mdash;Sir <span class="sc">William
Davison</span> thundered against the Home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id="page513"></a>[pg 513]</span>
Office for not taking steps to prevent
the desecration of the Nelson Column
by the delivery of seditious speeches.
Sir <span class="sc">John Baird</span> explained that it was
impossible to know beforehand what sort
of speech was going to be delivered. But
his critic would have none of this paltry
excuse. "Did not the regulations provide,"
he boomed, "that the objects of
the meetings must be specified?" Fortunately
for the Minister, who had nearly
been blown off the Treasury Bench, Mr.
<span class="sc">Hogge</span> came to the rescue. "Is it not
a fact," he inquired, "that the monument
was erected to a man who turned
a blind eye to orders?"</p>

<p>The strange case of Lord <span class="sc">Rothermere</span>
and the Committee on Public
Accounts was further investigated. The
Committee had reported that a certain
stationery contract for the Air Ministry
had been extravagant and improper.
The <span class="sc">Air Minister</span> at the time was the
noble Lord who has lately been so eloquent
about "squander-mania," but he
has since, in a letter to the Press, declared
that he never signed or initialled
the order. Lieut.-Colonel <span class="sc">Archer-Shee</span>
and Mr. <span class="sc">Ormsby-Gore</span> sought the
opinion of the Treasury on the transaction,
and Mr. <span class="sc">Baldwin</span> replied that
it was certainly usual for a Minister to
be held responsible for his expenditure,
and that if subordinate officials were
thrown over by their chiefs it would be
bad for the Service.</p>

<p>The Lords' amendments to the Commons'
amendments to the Lords' amendments
to the Government of Ireland
Bill were agreed to. Sir <span class="sc">L. Worthington-Evans</span>
thought to improve the occasion
by a neat little speech expressing
goodwill to Ireland, and, much to his
surprise, found himself in collision with
the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, who observed that this
was not the time for First Reading
speeches.</p>

<p>It was rather hard on Lord <span class="sc">Peel</span>, as
the grandson of the great Sir <span class="sc">Robert</span>,
to have to sponsor the Dyestuffs Bill.
He frankly described it as "a disagreeable
pill." Lord <span class="sc">Emmott</span> and other Peers
showed a strong disinclination to take
their medicine, but Lord <span class="sc">Moulton</span> said
that the chemists&mdash;naturally enough&mdash;were
all in favour of it, and persuaded
the House to swallow the bolus.</p>

<p>In the course of an eleventh-hour
effort to destroy the Agriculture Bill
Lord <span class="sc">Lincolnshire</span> described the <span class="sc">Prime
Minister's</span> Christmas motto as <i>Tax
Vobiscum</i>; and the success of his jape
served as a partial solace for the defeat
of his motion.</p>

<h3>AT THE PLAY</h3>.

<h4>"<span class="sc">Peter Pan</span>."</h4>

<p><i>Peter Pan</i>, the play, must by now
have long overtaken the age of <i>Peter
Pan</i>, the boy; but, like him, it never
grows any older. The cast may change,
but that seems to make hardly any
difference. The new <i>Peter</i> (Miss <span class="sc">Edna
Best</span>) is as good as any of them.
Graceful of shape and lithe of limb, he
is still essentially a boy, the realised
figure of <span class="sc">Barrie's</span> fancy; a little aloof
and inscrutable; romantic, too, in his
very detachment from the sentiment of
romance that he provokes. Miss <span class="sc">Freda
Godfrey</span>, the new <i>Wendy</i>, would have
seemed good if we had not known better
ones. To be frank, she looked rather
too mature for the part; she needed a
more childlike air to give piquancy to
her assumption of maternal responsibilities.
It was pleasant to see Mr. <span class="sc">Henry
Ainley</span> unbend to the task, simple for
him, of playing <i>Captain Hook</i> and <i>Mr.
Darling</i>. One admired his self-control
in refusing to impose new subtleties
upon established and sacred tradition.</p>

<p>Of familiar friends, age has not withered
the compelling charms of Mr. <span class="sc">Shelton's</span>
<i>Smee</i>, nor, in the person of Mr.
<span class="sc">Cleave</span>, has custom staled the infinite
futility of <i>Slightly</i>. I was glad, too, to
find Miss <span class="sc">Sybil Carlisle</span> back in the
part of <i>Mrs. Darling</i>, which she played
most appealingly.</p>

<p>The lagoon scene was cut out this
year; perhaps it was thought that there
is enough lagoon in London just now.
I could more willingly have spared the
business of <i>Mr. Darling</i> and the kennel,
the one blot in the play. My impression
of this grotesquerie has not changed
since I first saw <i>Peter Pan</i>.</p>

<p>Among new impressions was a feeling
that the domestic details of the
First Act are a little too leisurely, so
that I appreciated the impatience of
my little neighbour for the arrival of
<i>Peter Pan</i>, whose acquaintance she had
still to make. Also from the presence
of children in my party I became conscious
how much of the humour of the
play&mdash;its burlesque, for example, of
the stage villain&mdash;is only seizable by
children who have grown up. <span class="sc">Barrie</span>
wrote it, of course, to please the eternal
child in himself, but forgot now and
then what an unusual child it was.</p>

<h3>ST. CECILIA OF CREMONA.</h3>

<p><i>Punch</i> has no desire to plunge into
the controversy which has arisen over
the employment of women in professional
orchestras, especially as the cause
has already been practically won, and
here, at any rate, the saying, "What
Lancashire thinks to-day England will
think to-morrow," has failed to justify
itself. The example of Manchester is
not being followed in London, and what
is deemed advisable for the Free Trade
Hall in one city is not to dominate the
policy of the Queen's Hall in the other.</p>

<p>But without going into the arguable
points of this latest duel of the
sexes, Mr. Punch, already in the last
year which completes his fourth score,
may be allowed to indulge in an old
man's privilege of retrospect and incidentally
to congratulate the ladies on
the wonderful and triumphant progress
they have made in instrumental art
since the roaring 'forties. For in the
'forties women, though still supreme
on the lyric stage, had hardly begun
to assert themselves as executants,
save on the pianoforte. <i>Punch</i> well
remembers <span class="sc">Liszt</span>&mdash;with the spelling
of whose name he had considerable
difficulty&mdash;in his meteoric pianofortitude.
But the young <span class="sc">Wilma Neruda</span>,
who visited London in 1849, escaped
his benevolent notice. She was then
only ten. It was not until twenty
years later that, as Madame <span class="sc">Norman-Neruda</span>,
she revisited London, proved
that consummate skill could be combined
with admirable grace in a woman-violinist,
took her place as a leader of
the quartet at the Monday "Pops," upset
the tyranny of the pianoforte and harp
as the only instruments suitable for the
young person, and virtually created the
professional woman-violinist. Indeed,
she may be said to have at once made
the fiddle fashionable and profitable for
girls.</p>

<p>On its invasion of Mayfair the
pencil of <span class="sc">Du Maurier</span> furnishes the
best comment. Before 1869, woman-violinists
were only single spies; now
they are to be reckoned in battalions.
And they no longer "play the easiest
passages with the greatest difficulty,"
as was once said of an incompetent
male pianist, but in all departments of
technique and interpretation have fully
earned Sir <span class="sc">Henry Wood's</span> tribute to
their skill, sincerity and delicacy.
When the eminent conductor goes on,
in his catalogue of their excellences, to
say, "They do not drink, and they
do not smoke as much as men," he
reminds Mr. Punch of two historic
sayings of a famous foreign conductor.
The first was uttered at a rehearsal
of the Venusberg music from <i>Tannh&auml;user:</i>
"Gentlemen, you play it as if
you were teetotalers&mdash;<i>which you are
not</i>." The other was his lament over
a fine but uncertain wind-instrument
player: "With &mdash;&mdash; it is always Quench,
Quench, Quench."</p>

<p>Mr. Punch is old-fashioned enough
to hope that, whether teetotalers or
not, the ladies will leave trombones and
tubas severely alone, and confine their
instrumental energies mainly to the
nice conduct of the leading strings&mdash;the
aristocrats of the orchestra, the
sovereigns of the chamber concert.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4><i>(By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.)</i></h4>

<p>I can't help thinking that Mr. <span class="sc">H. G. Hibbert</span> has not
chosen altogether the right name for his second volume of
theatrical and Bohemian gossip, <i>A Playgoer's Memories</i>
(<span class="sc">Grant Richards</span>). It is not so unsophisticated as the
title had somehow led me to expect. Indeed "unsophisticated"
is perhaps the last epithet that could justly be applied
to Mr. <span class="sc">Hibbert's</span> memories. I fancy I had unconsciously
been looking for something more in the style of my own
ignorant playgoing. "How wonderful she was in that
scene with the broker's man," or "Do you remember the
opening of the Third Act?" Not thus Mr. <span class="sc">Hibbert</span>. For
him the play itself is far less the thing than a peg upon
which to hang all sorts of tags and bobtails of recollection,
financial, technical and just not scandalous because of the
discretion of the telling. His book is a repository of
theatrical information, but the great part of it of more
absorbing concern for the manager's-room or the stage-door
than, say, the dress
circle. But I must not be
wanting in gratitude for
the entertainment which,
for all this carping, I certainly
derived from it. As
an expert on stage finance,
for example, to-day and
forty years back, Mr.
<span class="sc">Hibbert</span> has revelations
that may well cause the
least concerned to marvel.
And there is an appendix,
which gives a list of Drury
Lane pantomimes, with
casts, for half a century,
including, of course, the
incomparable first one;
but that is not a memory
of this world. A book to
be kept for odd references
in two senses.</p>

<p>What most interfered
with my peace of mind
over <i>The Happy Highways</i>
(<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>) was, I think, its almost entire absence
of highway, and the exceedingly unhappy nature of its
confused and uncharted lanes. Indeed, I am wondering
now if the title may not have been an instance of bitter
irony on the part of Miss <span class="sc">Storm Jameson</span>. Certainly a
more formless mass of writing never within my experience
masqueraded as a novel. There are ideas and reflections&mdash;these
last mostly angry and vaguely socialistic&mdash;and here
and there glimpses of illusory narrative about a group of
young persons, brothers and a girl-friend, who live at Herne
Hill, attend King's College and talk (oh, but interminably)
the worst pamphlet-talk of the pre-war age. It is, I take
it, a reviewer's job to stifle his boredom and push on
resolutely through the dust to find what good, if any, may
be hidden by it. I will admit therefore some vague interest
in the record of how the War hit such persons as these.
Also (to the credit of the author as tale-teller) she does
allow one of the young men to earn a scholarship, and for
no sane reason to depart instantly thereupon before the mast
of a sailing-ship; also another, the central figure, to fall in
love with the girl. The book is in three parts, of which the
third is superfluously specialized as "chaos." Whether
Miss <span class="sc">Jameson</span> will yet write a story I am unable to say;
I rather wonder, however, that Messrs. <span class="sc">Heinemann</span> did not
suggest to her that these heterogeneous pages would furnish
excellent material for the experiment.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have discovered that Miss <span class="sc">Peggy Webling</span> has quite
a remarkable talent for making ordinary places and people
seem improbable. She achieves this in <i>Comedy Corner</i>
(<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>) by sketching in her scenery quite competently
and then allowing her characters to live lives, amongst it, so
fraught with coincidence, so swayed by the most unlikely
impulses, that a small draper's shop, a West End "Hattery"
and an almshouse for old actresses become the most extraordinary
places on earth, where anything might happen
and nobody would be surprised. <i>Winnie</i>, her heroine, behaves
more improbably than anyone else, but she is such a
dear little goose that most amiable readers will be quite
glad that she doesn't have to suffer as much as such geese
would if they existed in real life. You can see from this
that it is one of those books that are full of real niceness
and goodwill, and it has besides plenty of plot and lots of
interesting characters, and
yet somehow it gives you
the feeling of being out of
focus. You read on, expecting
every moment that
clever Miss <span class="sc">Webling</span> will
give things a little push
in the right direction and
make them seem true,
and, while you are reading
and hoping, you come
to the happy ending.</p>

<hr />

<p>Should you enter <i>The
Gates of Tien T'ze</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder
and Stoughton</span>) you
will not regret it, but it is
possible that you may be&mdash;as
I was&mdash;a little breathless
before the end of this
vehement story is reached.
The average tale of criminals
and detectives is not
apt to move slowly, but
here Mr. <span class="sc">Leslie Howard
Gordon</span> maintains the
speed of a half-mile relay race. I am not going to reveal his
mystery except to say that <i>Tien T'ze</i> was a Chinese organisation
which perpetrated crimes, and that <i>Donald Craig</i>,
<i>Kyrle Durand</i>&mdash;his secretary (female) and cousin&mdash;and <i>Bruce
MacIvor</i>, superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Department,
were employed in tracking it down and smashing
it to pieces. Never have I met anyone in fiction (let fact
alone) so clever as <i>Kyrle</i> in getting herself and her friends
out of tight places. When <i>Craig</i> and <i>MacIvor</i> were so
beset by <i>Tien T'ze</i> that their last hour seemed to have
come I found myself saying, "It is time for <i>Kyrle</i> to
emerge from her machine," and she emerged. In a novel
of this <i>genre</i> it is essential that the excitement should
never fall below fever-heat, but Mr. <span class="sc">Gordon's</span> book does
better than that; its temperature would, I think, burst
any ordinary thermometer.</p>

<h3>AS WE SEE OTHERS: A CANDID APPRECIATION OF U.S.A.</h3>

<p>The liner <i>de luxe</i> had swung in past Sandy Hook, and the tender had
already come alongside with its mail
and Press-gang. There ensued a furious race to interview the most distinguished
passenger, and it was by the representative
of <i>The Democratic Elevator</i>, who got there first, that the Sage, in the
very act of recording the emotions
provoked by his first sky-scraper, was <i>abord&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>"Mr. Punch, I guess?" said he. "Pleased to meet you, Sir. And what do you think
of the American nation?"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you now," asked Mr. Punch, "or wait till I've actually seen it?"</p>

<p>"Right here," said the interviewer, and drew his note-book.</p>

<p>"Well," began Mr. Punch, "I think a good deal of it&mdash;I mean, I think a good deal
about it. And it
nearly always makes me smile. Of course you won't understand why it nearly
always makes me smile, because
we don't see fun in the same things. You don't appreciate our humour, and
therefore you say that we haven't
any. And if we don't appreciate your humour that proves again that we haven't
any. So you'll never understand
why it makes me smile, sometimes gently and sometimes rather bitterly, to think
about your nation; but
I'll tell you just the same.</p>

<p>"In the first place, what you call 'America' is only a small fraction of the
American continent, not
even as large as British North America. And in the second place what you call
your 'nation'&mdash;well, some rude
person once said of it that it isn't really a nation at all, but just a picnic.
I won't go so far as that, but
I hardly suppose you will be much better pleased if I call it a League of
Nations. That is a phrase that you
hate, because your President <span class="sc">Wilson</span> loves it.</p>

<p>"By the way, I must be very careful how I speak of your President, because
you're so sensitive on that
subject. You allow yourselves to abuse him as the head of a political party, but
if other nations so much as
question his omniscience he suddenly becomes the Head of a Sovereign State. An
English Cabinet Minister once
told me how an American gave vent in conversation to the most violent language
in regard to the policy of the
President of the day, and when at the end the Englishman very quietly said, 'I
am inclined to agree with you,'
the American turned on him in a fury, saying: 'Sir, I didn't come here to have
my country insulted!'</p>

<p>"However, to return to your League of Nations. In England (where I come from)
they are just now reviving
a play by Mr. <span class="sc">Israel Zangwill</span>, in which, if I recall it rightly, he
makes out your country to be the
Melting Pot into which every sort of fancy alien type is thrown, and turned out
a pattern American citizen, a
member of a United Family. I wish I could believe it. It seems to us that your
German, even after passing
through the Melting Pot, remains a German; that your Irishman, however much he
Americanises himself for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>[pg 518]</span>
purposes of political power and graft, remains an Irishman. You never seem to
get together as a nation, except
when you go to war, and even then you don't keep it up, for you're not together
now, although you're still at
war with Germany. The rest of the time you seem to spend in having Elections and
'placating' (I think that's
what you call it) the German interest, or the negro interest, or the Sinn Fein
interest.</p>

<p>"And this brings me to the point that makes me smile most of all&mdash;when it
doesn't make me weep.
Isn't it a pathetic thing that a really great and strong people like you should
be so weak and little as to let
your Press sympathise blatantly with the campaign of murder in Ireland; to
suffer that campaign to be actively
assisted by American gunmen; to look on while it is being financed by American
money, here employed in conjunction
with the resources of that very Bolshevism which you take care to treat as
criminal in your own country?</p>

<p>"Isn't it pitiful that you should regard reprisals (hateful though they may be)
as worse than the hideous
murders which provoked them; forgetting your own addiction to lynch law;
forgetting too (as some of our own
people forget) that the sanctity of the law depends as much upon the goodwill
and assistance of the populace as
it does upon the police, and cannot else be maintained?</p>

<p>"Indeed your memory is not very good. Your Monroe Doctrine, which insists that
nobody from outside
shall interfere with your affairs, escapes you whenever you want to interfere
with other people's. You even forget,
at convenient times, your own Civil War. Just as there was not a protest made by
you against the methods of
our blockade of Germany for which an answer could not be found in some precedent
set by you in that War
of North and South, so now the best answer to your sympathy with the
preposterous claims of an Irish Republic
is to be found in those four years in which you fought so bloodily to preserve
the integrity of your own Union.</p>

<p>"Yet you let men like <span class="sc">De Valera</span> go at large proclaiming the brutal
tyranny of the alien Saxon and
advertising his country as a Sovereign State&mdash;all because you have to 'placate'
the Irish interest. I should very
much like to hear what you would think of us if at our Elections we ran an
Anti-You campaign and even made
Intervention a plank in our platform (as one of your Parties did) for the sake
of 'placating' the niggers or the
Cubans or the Filipinos or any other sort of Dago in our midst.</p>

<p>"Of course we are told&mdash;and of course I believe it&mdash;that the 'best' American
sentiment is all right. But, if so,
it must be cherished by a very select few, or they would never tolerate a
condition of things so rotten that, unless
your coming President finds some cure for it, you are like to become the
laughing-stock of Europe. I am almost
tempted to go into the Melting Pot myself and show you, as none but an American
citizen would ever be allowed
to show you, how it is to be done. Unfortunately I am too busy elsewhere,
putting my own country right.</p>

<p>"But to conclude&mdash;for I see that we are drawing close to the landing-stage&mdash;I do
hope that in my
desire to be genial I have not been too flattering. No true friend ever
flatters. And in my heart, which has
some of our common blood in it (notoriously thicker than water), I cannot help
loving your country, and would
love it better still if only it gave me a better chance. Indeed, I belong at
home to a Society for the Promotion
of Anglo-American Friendship. More than that"&mdash;and here the Sage was seen to
probe into a voluminous and
bulging breast-pocket&mdash;"I have brought with me a token of affection designed to
stimulate a mutual cordiality."</p>

<p>"<i>Not</i> a flask of whisky?" exclaimed the representative of <i>The
Democratic Elevator</i>, suddenly moved to animation.</p>

<p>"No, not that, not that, my child," said Mr. Punch, "but something far, far
better for you; something that
gives you, among other less serious matter, a record of the way in which we in
England, with private troubles
of our own no easier than yours to bear, and exhausted with twice as many years
of sacrifice in the War of
Liberty (whose colossal effigy I have just had the pleasure to remark), still
try to play an honourable part in
that society of nations from which you have apparently resolved, for your better
ease and comfort, to cut yourselves
off. Be good enough to accept, in the spirit of benevolence in which I offer it,
this copy of my</p>
